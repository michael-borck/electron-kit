I'm building a branded Electron app template/theme system. I have multiple existing Electron apps that I want to analyze to extract common
  patterns and create a reusable template.

  CONTEXT:
  - I want consistent branding across all my Electron apps
  - Most apps have collapsible sidebars with main content areas
  - I'm using Material-UI and want to create a centralized theme
  - Goal is to create a template for new apps and retrofit existing ones
  - I need github workflow to geterate builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Common .gitignore file
  - I want to ensure accessibility and good UX practices are followed
  - I want to identify good ideas from one app that others are missing
  - I want to ensure the template is flexible enough for future apps

  TASK:
  Please analyze my existing Electron apps to:
  1. Identify common UI patterns (layouts, components, navigation)
  2. Find reusable elements that should be in the template
  3. Spot inconsistencies that the template should standardize
  4. Recommend the optimal template structure
  5. Suggest retrofitting strategy for existing apps
  6. **Identify good ideas from one app that others are missing** - cross-pollinate features
  7. **Recommend desktop UI/UX best practices** I should add to the template
  8. **Suggest missing accessibility/UX features** like:
     - Font size controls for users
     - Typography consistency
     - Keyboard shortcuts
     - Theme switching (light/dark)
     - Window state persistence
     - Any other desktop-specific UX patterns

  This covers cross-app feature discovery, best practices, and missing UX opportunities!

  I'll provide a file with paths to all my Electron app directories. Please examine the codebases and give me comprehensive recommendations
  for building the ideal branded template.

  Ready to start the analysis when you are!
